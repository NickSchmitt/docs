  "description": "The Grav instance on its own is not very useful without anything connected to it. A Pod is a lightweight bi-directional connection to the Grav instance. A Pod is created by calling the Connect() method on the Grav instance. The Grav instance can be connected to many Pods, up to thousands at once. A Pod can send messages to be routed through the bus, and it can receive messages from the bus.",
