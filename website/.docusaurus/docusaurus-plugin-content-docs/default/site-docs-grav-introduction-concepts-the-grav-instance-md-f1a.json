  "description": "The main component of Grav is the grav.Grav instance. It contains the core message bus that facilitates sending and receiving messages. Each application instance should get one Grav instance. If meshing is needed, Transport and Discovery plugins are configured when instantiating the Grav instance. Your application code then creates connections to the Grav instance in the form of Pods, which are discussed next.",
