# Compute APIs

You can find a detailed specification of Compute's APIs [here](https://suborbital-compute.readme.io/reference/api-reference).

## Administrative API

The Compute control plane exposes administrative APIs that are designed to help you and your users view, manage, and organize their functions. 

## Execution API

The execution API is used by your application servers to **execute** the functions your users have built.

## Builder API

The Compute builder service that you set up with Compute is capable of automatically building WebAssembly modules for you. It exposes an API that can build **AssemblyScript and Rust functions.**
