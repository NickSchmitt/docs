# 1. Create an environment token with Subo

To use Compute, you'll need an environment token which allows the control plane to authenticate with the Suborbital Compute Network.

## Install Subo

For macOS: use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew tap suborbital/subo
brew install subo
subo --version
```
**The `version` must be at least `v0.1.0` for full Compute support.**

For Linux (or Mac without Homebrew), install from the [Subo repository](https://github.com/suborbital/subo/releases).

## Generate your token

Run:
```bash
subo compute create token <email>
```

A verification code will be sent to your email address.

**Subo will print out your token.**

Keep this token safe (store it in your password manager), and use only when running or installing Compute.
