# About Atmo

Atmo is a self-hosted platform that uses a _Runnable bundle_ to run your described application.
The bundle includes two things: a [Directive](../concepts/the-directive.md), and a set of
[Runnables](../concepts/runnables.md) (WebAssembly modules compiled from various languages
such as TypeScript, Rust and Swift). A bundle contains everything needed to run your
application.
